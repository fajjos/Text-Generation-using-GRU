# Text-Generation-using-GRU
Text-Generation-GRU is a Python-based project that utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural networks, to generate text based on a given input sequence.
This project includes a web application built with Flask, allowing users to interactively input a starting text and generate a continuation of the text based on the trained model.

Key Features:

Utilizes GRU neural networks for text generation.
Includes a web application interface for easy interaction.
Allows users to input a starting text and generate text continuations of desired length.
Provides flexibility in adjusting parameters such as temperature for text generation.

DataSet Used: Penn's Treebank.

Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install the necessary dependencies.
Run the Flask web application.
Input a starting text and desired length of generated text.
View the generated text output.
Technologies Used:

Python
TensorFlow
Flask
HTML/CSS
